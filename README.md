# FNaF-1-PSP

A Fork of BasDev's FNaF 1 PSP by CesarR70
Mostly updated asset files to optimize memory utilization within the PSP & stop the constant crashing LOL

-Tested on ppsspp as well as a physical PSP 3000 running ARK-4 CFW v6.60

You need the PSP homebrew SDK to compile this. Download here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/minpspw/
